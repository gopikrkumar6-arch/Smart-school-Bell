## Build APK via GitHub Actions (No Android Studio Required)

If you don't have Android Studio installed, you can use GitHub Actions to build the APK automatically:

### Setup (One-time)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. The workflow will run automatically on every push to `main`/`master` branch

### Download Your APK

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Click on the latest workflow run
4. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
5. Download `smart-school-bell-debug.apk`
6. Install the APK on your Android device

### Manual Trigger

You can also manually trigger a build:
1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Select "Build Android APK" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Wait for the build to complete
5. Download the APK from artifacts

### Release Builds

To create a signed release APK:
1. Create a new release on GitHub
2. The release workflow will automatically build and attach the APK
3. Download from the release page

> [!NOTE]
> **First Build**: The first GitHub Actions build may take 5-10 minutes. Subsequent builds will be faster due to caching.
